#GUI With creatures in existence
Mode 1 - wildlands
  The world is a flat map essentially and the creatures navigate to food
  They will have simple life cycles - habitats etc
  There will be predators that only eat other creatures, prey which eat plants
  Decision making arise from biases
    Bias to cluster or stay solitary
    Bias to avoid predators when detected
    Bias to certain food types (high vs low energy)
    Memory? Knowledge of places with food

  Creature genome Features
    Biases above
    speed
    Weight
    Lifespan
    Reproduction habits (many vs single, who to reproduce with)
    detection range
      eyesight
      hearing
      smell


  problems to solve
    How do you get animals to act like animals (live one place, get food in another)
        Maybe have a bias against exposure that can go up or down, and have
        designated spots with low exposure (in forest/caves?)

    Getting predators to find prey
      Have detection
      Maybe a prey "trail" they can follow

    Damage/attacking
      Simple probability calculation?
        number of attackers
        damage potential
        hp
        speed
